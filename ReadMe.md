Hello, and welcome to "A trip to Neptune!"

My name is Alessandro Esposito Brescia and I created this game based on a tutorial by Christopher Lis that you can find here:

Of couse I had to make some adjustment and modify something in order to reach the result I wanted (even because his code wasn't always working properly...)

Anyway, the point of the game is guiding your austronaut-character to the last platform in the game. Use the keyboard command "a" to go left, "d" to go right and "w" to jump.

I took the liberty of putting one of my fav album as soundtrack - it's called Cenizas by Nicolas Jaar, check it out!
